# Database Migration to Turso-Only

## Summary
Successfully migrated from dual-database architecture (SQLite + Turso) to Turso-only configuration.

## Changes Made

### 1. Database Configuration
- **drizzle.config.ts**: Simplified to use only Turso dialect
- **src/lib/db/connection.ts**: Replaced SQLite connection with Turso LibSQL client
- **Removed**: src/lib/db/cloudConnection.ts (consolidated into connection.ts)

### 2. Package Dependencies
- **Removed**: `better-sqlite3` and `@types/better-sqlite3`
- **Kept**: `@libsql/client` for Turso connectivity

### 3. Database Services
- **src/services/database/base.ts**: Simplified to use single database connection
- **src/services/database/sync.ts**: Simplified to handle only offline queue processing
- **All service files**: Updated to use `getDb()` instead of `getLocalDb()`

### 4. API Routes
Updated all API routes to use the new connection:
- src/app/api/auth/change-pin/route.ts
- src/app/api/categories/counts/route.ts
- src/app/api/reports/scheduled/route.ts
- src/app/api/reports/scheduled/[id]/route.ts
- src/app/api/reports/scheduled/[id]/run/route.ts
- src/app/api/sync/status/route.ts
- src/app/api/sync/trigger/route.ts
- src/app/api/test-simple-sync/route.ts

### 5. Migration System
- **src/lib/db/migrate.ts**: Updated to use LibSQL client instead of better-sqlite3

### 6. Service Files
Updated all service files to use the new connection:
- src/services/auth/authService.ts
- src/services/dashboard/dashboardService.ts
- src/services/database/search.ts
- src/services/database/transactions.ts
- src/services/database/userActivity.ts
- src/services/reports/reportService.ts
- src/services/search/searchEngine.ts
- src/services/search/translationService.ts

## Benefits

1. **Simplified Architecture**: No more dual-database complexity
2. **Reduced Dependencies**: Removed SQLite-specific packages
3. **Better Scalability**: Direct cloud database access
4. **Easier Deployment**: No local database files to manage
5. **Consistent Data**: Single source of truth

## Environment Variables Required

Make sure these are set:
```
TURSO_DATABASE_URL=your_turso_database_url
TURSO_AUTH_TOKEN=your_turso_auth_token
```

## Next Steps

1. Run `pnpm install` to update dependencies
2. Run `pnpm db:migrate` to ensure database schema is up to date
3. Test the application to ensure all functionality works
4. Update any remaining test files that mock the old database connections

## Notes

- The offline queue system is still in place for handling operations when connectivity is poor
- FTS5 search functionality has been updated to work with LibSQL
- All timestamp handling has been updated to use Unix timestamps (seconds) as expected by SQLite/LibSQL
