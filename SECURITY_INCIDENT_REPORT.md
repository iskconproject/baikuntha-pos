# Security Incident Report

## üö® Critical Security Issue: Hardcoded API Tokens

### Issue Description
**Date**: January 8, 2025  
**Severity**: CRITICAL  
**Type**: Hardcoded API Tokens in Source Code  

During development of database management scripts, API tokens were accidentally hardcoded as fallback values in the following files:
- `scripts/copy-production-data.js`
- `scripts/db-config.js`

### Tokens Exposed
- Turso Production Database Token
- Turso Staging Database Token

### Impact Assessment
- **Risk Level**: HIGH
- **Exposure**: Tokens were committed to version control
- **Duration**: Approximately 30 minutes before detection and fix
- **Access**: Anyone with repository access could see the tokens

### Immediate Actions Taken

#### 1. Token Removal ‚úÖ
- Removed all hardcoded tokens from script files
- Replaced with proper environment variable validation
- Added security checks to prevent script execution without proper tokens

#### 2. Script Security Improvements ‚úÖ
- Added environment variable validation
- Scripts now fail gracefully if tokens are missing
- Added clear error messages for missing configuration

#### 3. Enhanced Security Measures ‚úÖ
- Updated `.env.example` with security warnings
- Added validation functions to check for required environment variables
- Improved documentation on secure token management

### Code Changes Made

#### Before (INSECURE):
```javascript
const PRODUCTION_CONFIG = {
  url: 'libsql://...',
  authToken: process.env.TOKEN || 'eyJhbGciOiJFZERTQSIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9...' // ‚ùå EXPOSED TOKEN
};
```

#### After (SECURE):
```javascript
// Validate required environment variables
function validateEnvironment() {
  const required = ['TURSO_PRODUCTION_AUTH_TOKEN', 'TURSO_STAGING_AUTH_TOKEN'];
  const missing = required.filter(key => !process.env[key]);
  
  if (missing.length > 0) {
    console.error('‚ùå Missing required environment variables');
    process.exit(1);
  }
}

const PRODUCTION_CONFIG = {
  url: process.env.TURSO_PRODUCTION_DATABASE_URL,
  authToken: process.env.TURSO_PRODUCTION_AUTH_TOKEN // ‚úÖ SECURE
};
```

### Security Measures Implemented

#### 1. Environment Variable Validation
- Scripts now validate all required environment variables before execution
- Clear error messages guide users to proper configuration
- No fallback tokens that could expose credentials

#### 2. Enhanced Documentation
- Updated security guidelines in `docs/SECURITY.md`
- Added security warnings in `.env.example`
- Clear instructions for secure token management

#### 3. Git History Considerations
- Tokens were exposed in git commits
- **Recommendation**: Consider the exposed tokens compromised
- **Action Required**: Rotate all exposed tokens immediately

### Recommended Actions

#### Immediate (URGENT)
1. **Rotate all exposed tokens** in Turso dashboard
2. **Generate new tokens** for both staging and production databases
3. **Update environment variables** with new tokens
4. **Audit access logs** for any unauthorized usage

#### Short-term
1. **Review all scripts** for similar security issues
2. **Implement automated security scanning** in CI/CD pipeline
3. **Team security training** on secure coding practices
4. **Regular security audits** of codebase

#### Long-term
1. **Implement secret management service** (AWS Secrets Manager, etc.)
2. **Automated token rotation** procedures
3. **Security monitoring** and alerting
4. **Regular penetration testing**

### Lessons Learned

#### What Went Wrong
1. **Convenience over Security**: Used fallback tokens for "convenience"
2. **Insufficient Review**: Security implications not properly considered
3. **Missing Validation**: No checks for secure coding practices

#### What Went Right
1. **Quick Detection**: Issue was identified quickly
2. **Immediate Response**: Tokens removed within 30 minutes
3. **Comprehensive Fix**: Implemented proper security measures
4. **Documentation**: Thorough documentation of incident and fixes

### Prevention Measures

#### Code Review Checklist
- [ ] No hardcoded credentials in any files
- [ ] All sensitive data uses environment variables
- [ ] Proper validation of required environment variables
- [ ] Security implications considered and documented

#### Automated Checks
- [ ] Pre-commit hooks to scan for credentials
- [ ] CI/CD pipeline security scanning
- [ ] Regular dependency security audits
- [ ] Automated secret detection tools

#### Team Practices
- [ ] Security-first mindset in development
- [ ] Regular security training and updates
- [ ] Clear incident response procedures
- [ ] Documentation of security best practices

### Current Status

#### ‚úÖ Resolved
- Hardcoded tokens removed from all files
- Proper environment variable validation implemented
- Security documentation updated
- Scripts function correctly with secure configuration

#### ‚ö†Ô∏è Action Required
- **CRITICAL**: Rotate all exposed tokens immediately
- Update team members with new tokens
- Audit access logs for suspicious activity
- Consider implementing additional security measures
